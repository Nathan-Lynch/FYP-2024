#  Using reinforcement learning to teach robots how to walk
We aim to use a deep learning neural network approach to not just detect, but numerically quantify domain shifts experienced by an reinforcement learning (RL) agent. 
In order to achieve this the existing algorithm Reactive Exploration (which is itself based on an Intrinsic Curiosity Module algorithm) will be examined under new experimental conditions. 
Using metrics tracked by the algorithm, predictability of the distance between a current policy and its suitability to its new domain-shifted environment will be investigated.
